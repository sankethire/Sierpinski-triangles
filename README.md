# Sierpinski-triangles
 Fractal and attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles.
### The evolution of the Sierpinski triangle.

### To generate pattern enter commands in terminal as follows:
```
$ python src/sierpinski.py
```
After entering the above command program will ask for two values n and i. Enter those two values one by one.
where n is triangle size factor in the power of 2 and is greater than equal to 4 and,
      i is number of iterations to form the recursive Sierpinski triangles and is between (1,log<sub>2</sub>(n)) both                 inclusive.
#### For example:      
```
32
4
```
Try with various values of i in between (1,log<sub>2</sub>(n)) for various values of n.
